#+TITLE: 57 Exercises for Programmers

Admittedly, I have a serial addiction to trying new languages.

* Backlog
Roughly in order in which I intend on completing them.

** [-] Clojure (=clj/=)
** [-] Ruby (=rb/=)
** [ ] C (=c/=)
** [ ] Go (=go/=)
** [ ] Rust (=rs/=)
** [ ] Haskell (=hs/=)
** [ ] Elixir (=exs/=)
** [ ] Common Lisp (=cl/=)
** [ ] Zig (=zig/=)
** [ ] OCaml (=ml/=)

* Others?
Some other languages that I'm at least marginally curious about learning:
+ Swift (iOS development)
+ Kotlin (Android development)
+ Idris (Esoteric type research!?)
+ Elm (web UI language that doesn't suck)
+ Crystal (/might/ be worth keeping an eye on as alternative to Go/Rust for me)
+ R/Julia (should learn some data science)
+ Other Lisps (Chicken Scheme, Racket, Janet, Fennel)
+ Smalltalk/Eiffel (the OG OOP langs)

* Non-goals
Ironically, this mostly comprises languages I /should/ learn if I want to make money and pad my resume. Unfortunately, they all pretty much suck to work with.
+ Python
+ Java
+ C#
+ C++
+ JavaScript
+ TypeScript
+ PHP
+ Visual Basic
+ Ada
